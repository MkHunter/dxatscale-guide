# Diff Package

A diff package is a variant of '[source package](source-packages.md)' , where the contents of the package only contain the components that are changed. This package is generated by sfpowerscripts by computing a `git diff` of the current commit id against a baseline set in the devhub org&#x20;

A diff  package mimics a changeset model, where only changes are contained in the artifact. As such, this package is always an incremental package. It only deploys the changes incrementally over what is already in the target org.  Unless both previous version and the current version have the exact same components, a diff package can never be rolled back, as the impact on the org is unpredictable. It is always recommended to roll forward  a diff package.



{% hint style="danger" %}
Diff packages should never be used with scratch orgs. It should be used with sandboxes only.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
A diff  package  is the least consistent package among the various package types available within sfpowerscripts, and should only be used for transitioning to a modular development model as prescribed by DX@Scale \

The below example demonstrates a sfdx-project.json where the package `unpackaged` is a diff package. You can mark a diff package with the type 'diff'. All other attributes applicable  to source packages are applicable for diff packages.

```
// sfdx-project.json

{
  "packageDirectories": [
    {
      "path": "util",
      "default": false,
      "package": "Expense-Manager-Util",

A manual entry in `sfpowerscripts_Artifact2__c` should be made with the name of the package and the baseline commit id and version.  Subsequent deployments will automatically reset the baseline when the package gets deployed to DevHub
