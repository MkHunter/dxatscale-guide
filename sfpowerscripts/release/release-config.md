# Release Config

A release configuration defines how packages should be organized across your project in terms of various activites be it validating, building or release.  All sfpowerscripts orchestrator command supports a release config input, which can be used to filter the commands to operate only on the packages as mentioned in the release configuration.  A release configuration can be used to create workflows such as supporting parallel development and release  of independent domains.=

A release config follows a very similar structure to that of a release definition but with additonal filters available.  By combining release config and [release definition generator](release-defn-generator.md) , one can create a release definition at any given point of a repository.&#x20;

```yaml
// Sample release config file

---
â€‹
includeOnlyArtifacts:
  - src-env-specific-pre
  - src-env-specific-alias-pre
  - core-crm
  - telephony-service
excludePackageDependencies:
  - Genesys Cloud for Salesforce
  - Marketing Cloud
releasedefinitionProperties:
  changelog:
    workItemFilters:
      -  BRO-[0-9]{3,4}
    workItemUrl: https://bro.atlassian.net/browse
    limit: 30

```
