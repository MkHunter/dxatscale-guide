The   developers have the option to pick a source sandbox.  If the source sandbox is anything other than production, the developer sandbox will be cloned from the provided source sandbox. The sandboxes created will be kept for a maximum of 15 days or the number of days the developer has specified (whichever is lesser).\
\
Upon successful creation of a sandbox the requested user will receive an email with a reset password for the particular sandbox. The issue will be also updated with the status of the username and the duration of days upon which the sandbox will be deleted\
